## Project Report Initiatives
---
- PartEnum is one of the algorithm that can be enchanced by VGRAM included in Flamingo
- Actually VGRAM is not in Flamingo, so it would have to be obtained elsewhere or implemented in-house
- DivideSkip, MergeSkip, ScanCount are included in Flamingo's ListMerger

### Goals for Progress Report
- (Roughly) Understand how these algorithms work and the data structres beneath
    - Flamingo.util (data structures)
    - Flamingo.common (data structures)
    - Flamingo.listmerger (contains DivideSkip, MergeSkip, ScanCount)
    - etc.

- Make sure those relevant algorithms run on your linux environment
    - Run those on some small sized test data, record results
    - Run DivideSkip, MergeSkip, ScanCount
    - Run PartEnum

- Continue reading papers related to these algorithms
    - so that the progress report content can be written confidently
